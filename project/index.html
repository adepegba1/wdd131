                <div class="introduction">
                    <p>Are you overwhelmed with spreadsheets, reports, or admin tasks? I help businesses turn raw data
                        into
                        insights and manage
                        back-office operations efficiently. With over 5 years of experience helping businesses make
                        informed
                        decisions,
                        streamline operations, and optimize performance through data-driven strategies and remote
                        support.
                    </p>

                    <p>In my role as a Data Analyst, I specialize in turning raw data into meaningful insights using
                        tools
                        like
                        Excel, SQL, and
                        Power BI. I'm proficient in using advanced Excel functions (VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, PMT, IRR,
                        NPV),
                        PivotTables, and Power
                        Query to clean, transform, and analyze data. I write and optimize SQL queries to manage, update,
                        and
                        extract insights
                        from large databases, and I build interactive dashboards and visualizations in Power BI using
                        DAX to
                        communicate
                        findings to stakeholders clearly and effectively.</p>

                    <p>Certified as a Virtual Assistant through ALX, I provide reliable remote administrative support,
                        including
                        email
                        management, calendar coordination, data entry, task tracking, and expense reporting. I use tools
                        like
                        Microsoft Office,
                        Google Workspace, and task management platforms to deliver timely, organized, and
                        detail-oriented
                        assistance that helps
                        clients stay productive and focused.</p>

                    <p>With a background in Accounting, I assist businesses with financial analysis, budgeting, and
                        reporting. I
                        leverage tools
                        like Excel to manage cash flow, calculate interest, and evaluate investment returns. My ability
                        to
                        work
                        with both
                        operational and financial data makes me a well-rounded asset to any team.</p>

                    <p>In addition to my client work, I'm passionate about education and have mentored over 10 students,
                        teaching them how to
                        use data analytics tools to extract insights, solve business problems, and launch their careers
                        in
                        tech.
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm always open to freelance, part-time, or full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills
                        in
                        data
                        analysis,
                        virtual assistance, or financial support to create value.</p>
